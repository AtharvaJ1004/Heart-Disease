## Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular diseases(CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using Logistic Regression.

## What is Logistic Regression ?

Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes . It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.

## Libraries Used - 
  1. Pandas
  2. Matplotlib
  3. Seaborn
  4. Scikit-Learn
  
## Dataset Used -
  "framingham.csv"
  
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-years risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
